I'm a seasoned technology professional currently holding the position of Principal Site Reliability Engineer at [Talkdesk](https://talkdesk.com/). My journey in the tech world has been shaped by a deep passion for automation and a relentless pursuit of building reliable and scalable systems.

In addition to my role at Talkdesk, I've been a co-organizer of the [DevOps Porto meetup](https://devopsporto.com/). This experience has allowed me to contribute actively to the local tech community, fostering collaboration, and knowledge-sharing among professionals interested in DevOps practices.

Throughout my career, I've dedicated myself to optimizing and streamlining operations. My focus lies in designing and implementing robust systems that not only meet the demands of today's dynamic technological landscape but also anticipate the challenges of tomorrow.

In my downtime, I enjoy staying updated on the latest developments in cloud computing, distributed systems, and emerging technologies.
